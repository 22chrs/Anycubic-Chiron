Suggestions are always welcome! Keep in mind though, this firmware should stay compatible with a stock i3 Mega. Of course support for popular mods can be added.
Example of a valid request: "Please enable filament change via M600" or "Add support for the Mega-S upgrade kit"
Example of an invalid request: "I have modded my printer with a dual extruder. Can you please add support for this?"

Feel free to fork this project and customize it to your own needs, a starting point would be this page:
